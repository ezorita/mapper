OAK mapper known issues:
- hitmap_analysis and fuse_matches have issues with reverse strand sequences.

- The length of the alignment in align.c and the posterior assignments in hitmap.c may have offsets of 1.

- In align_nw, if i reaches len_q it stops, but it may happen that the best path is still some nucleotides above. So it may  be worth to extend the matrix in a rectangular fashion.
