OAK mapper known issues:
- The hit value returned by poucet in a pebble_t structure indicates the matched length of the query in rowid.
  This value is computed both in dash and in the recursive poucet. The way it is computed right now may not be robust.

- The length of the alignment in align.c and the posterior assignments in hitmap.c may have offsets of 1.

- In align_nw, if i reaches len_q it stops, but it may happen that the best path is still some nucleotides above. So it may
  be worth to extend the matrix in a rectangular fashion.
